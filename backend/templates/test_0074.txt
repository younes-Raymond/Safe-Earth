+ the established mechanisms for controlling and reporting public
expenditure, including Treasury support or approval where necessary,
should be respected.
4.2.4 In particular, departments should consult the Treasury (and ALBs their sponsor
departments) at an early stage about proposals to undertake unusual transactions or
financing techniques. This applies especially to any transactions which may have
wider implications elsewhere in the public sector (see paragraph 2.3.4 and box 2.3).
4.2.5 Working with the accounting officer, the finance director of each public sector
organisation has special responsibility for seeing that the standards described in this
chapter are respected. Annex 4.1.sets this out in more detail.
Box 4.3: essentials of effective internal decision making
choice
* active management of the portfolio of risks and opportunities
+ appraisal of alternative courses of action using the techniques in the Green Book, and
including assessment of feasibility to achieve value for money
* where appropriate, use of models (see annex 4.2) or pilot studies to provide evidence
on which to make decisions among policy or project choices
* active steering of initiatives, eg reviews to take stock at critical points of projects
operation
* appropriate internal delegations, with a single senior responsible officer (SRO) for each
significant project or initiative, and a single senior person leading each end to end
process
* prompt, regular and meaningful management information on costs (including unit
costs), efficiency, quality and performance against targets to track progress and value
for money
* proportionate administration and enforcement mechanisms, without unnecessary
complexity
+ use of feedback from internal and external audit and elsewhere to improve performance
* regular risk monitoring, to track performance and experience and make adjustments in
response
afterwards
* mechanisms to evaluate policy, project and programme outputs and outcomes,
including whether to continue, adjust or end any continuing activities
* arrangements to draw out and propagate lessons from experience
4.3 Opportunity and risk
4.3.1 Embedded in each public sector organisation's internal systems there should
be arrangements for recognising, tracking and managing its opportunities and risks.
Each organisations governing body should make a considered choice about its
desired risk appetite, taking account of its legal obligations, ministersâ€™ policy
decisions, its business objectives, and public expectations of what it should deliver.
