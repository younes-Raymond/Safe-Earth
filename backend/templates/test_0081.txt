4.13.5 In addition, the Treasury is responsible for publishing certain aggregate
information about use of public resources, for example Whole of Government
Accounts (WGA) consolidating all central and local government organisations
accounts and comparisons of outturn with budgets. The Office for National
Statistics (ONS) also uses input from data gathered by the Treasury to publish the
national accounts.
4.13.6 In certain areas of public business it is also important or desirable to provide
adequate public access to physical assets. Unnecessary or disproportionate
restrictions should be avoided. Managed properly, this can be a valuable mechanism
to promote inclusion and enhance public accountability.
4.14 Dealing with initiatives
4.14.1 Public sector organisations need to integrate all the advice in this handbook
when introducing new policies or planning projects. Each is unique and will need
bespoke treatment. The checklist in box 4.8 brings the different factors together. It
applies directly to central government organisations but the principles will be of
value elsewhere.
