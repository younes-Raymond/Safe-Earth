* The circumstances of the person complaining, eg whether the action or inaction of the
public sector organisation has caused knock on effects or hardship.
* Whether the damage is likely to persist for some time.
* Whether any financial remedy would be taxable when paid to the person complaining.
* Any advice from the PHSO.
A4.14.11 If a compensation payment includes an element because the person
complaining has had to wait for their award, it should be calculated as simple
interest. The interest rate to be applied should be appropriate to the circumstances
and defensible against the facts. Some rates worth considering are the rate HMRC
pays on tax repayments and the rate used in court settlements.
A4.14.12 When a public sector organisation recognises that it needs a scheme for a
set of similar or connected claims after maladministration or service failure, it should
ensure that the arrangements chosen deal with all potential claimants equitably. It is
important that such schemes take into account the PHSO's Principles of good
administration2. They must be well designed since costs can escalate if a problem
turns out to be more extensive than initially expected.
A4.14.13 If those seeking compensation have suffered injustice or hardship in a way
which is likely to persist, it may not be appropriate to pay compensation as a lump
sum. Instead it may make sense to award a structured settlement with periodic (eg
monthly or annual) payments. Public sector organisations considering such
settlements should seek both legal and actuarial advice in drawing them up.
A4.14.14 Essentially, designing a compensation scheme is no different from
designing other services. Good management, efficiency, effectiveness and value for
money are key goals (see Chapter 4). Some specific issues which may require special
care for compensation schemes are outlined in box A4.14B.
Box A4.14B: Issues to consider in designing compensation schemes
* Clarify the coverage of the scheme.
* Set clear scheme rules, with supporting guidance, to implement the policy intention.
* Make the remedies fair and proportionate, avoiding bias, discrimination or prejudice.
* Ensure the scheme’s systems work, eg through pilot testing.
* Design in sufficient flexibility to cope with the characteristics of the claimant population.
* Check that the administration cost is not excessive — or simplify the scheme.
* If the scheme sets a precedent, make sure that it is acceptable generally.
+ Inform parliament appropriately, eg through a written statement and/or in the
estimates / annual accounts.
* Plan to evaluate the scheme at suitable point(s).
* Provide for closure of the scheme, unless there is good reason not to.
