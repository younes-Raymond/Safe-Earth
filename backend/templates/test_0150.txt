Annex 4.9
Governance in public sector organisations includes arrangements for preventing, countering and
dealing with fraud. This annex provides further detail.

A4.9.1 Accounting officers are responsible for managing public sector organisations’ risks,
including fraud. Each organisation faces a range of fraud risks specific to its
business, from internal and external sources. The Fraud Act 2006 recognises that a
criminal offence of fraud arises from causing a loss to an individual or legal entity
through the intentional misdeclaration of information; knowingly withholding
information; or through an abuse of position. The risk of a given fraud is usually
measured by the probability of its occurring and its impact in monetary and
reputational terms should it occur. Fraud can also have other impacts including
undermining the delivery of government policy objectives and outcomes and
physical or societal harm.
A4.9.2 In broad terms, managing the risk of fraud involves:

+ assessing the organisation's overall vulnerability to fraud;

+ identifying the areas most vulnerable to fraud risk;

«evaluating the scale of fraud risk;

«responding to fraud risk;

+ detecting fraud;

+ measuring the effectiveness of the fraud risk strategy; and

«reporting fraud.
A4.9.3 The most effective way to manage the risk of fraud is to prevent it from
happening by developing an effective anti-fraud culture.
For guidance on all these areas, see Tackling Internal Fraud’ and Tackling External
Fraud”.
