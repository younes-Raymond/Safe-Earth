6.7.3 The FReM sets out the information public sector organisations should publish
in their accounts. It should include analysis of income.
6.8 Taking stock
6.8.1 As with any other use of public resources, it is important to monitor
performance so that the undertaking can be adjusted as necessary to stay on track.
It is good practice to review the service routinely at least once a year, to check, and
if appropriate revise, the charging level. At intervals, a more fundamental review is
usually appropriate, eg on a timetable compatible with the dynamics of the service.
Box 6.4 suggests some issues to examine.
Box 6.4: reviewing a public service for which a charge is made
* Isitstill right for a public sector body to use public resources to supply the service?
* Are there any related services for which there might be a case for charging?
Â«Does the business structure still make sense? Are the assets used for the service
adequate?
* How can efficiency and effectiveness be improved so that charges can be lower or offer
better value?
* Is the financial objective right?
* For a statutory (or other public sector) service, if full costs are not recovered, why not?
* For a commercial service, does the target rate of return still reflect market rates?
* Isitstill appropriate to net off against costs any agreed charges above cost?
* Is there scope to secure economies of scale by developing a shared service?
* What developments might change the business climate?
* Do any discretionary services remain a good fit for the business model and wider
objectives?
+ Should any underused assets be redeployed, used to make a commercial return, or
sold?
* Would another business model (eg licensing, contracting out, privatising) be better?
