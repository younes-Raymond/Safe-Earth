+ employ internal management processes to ensure that transactions that give rise to
questions of propriety of tax arrangements are brought to the accounting officer's
or, if necessary, ministers attention.

A4.6.17 In the case of bids under the Private Finance (PF2), it is particularly important to ensure
that comparisons of competing bids take account of any tax planning by bidders. The Treasury's
Green Book provides for a tax adjusted Public Sector Comparator to allow for the (usually)
material tax difference between a PF2 option and the wholly public sector alternative. It would
be inappropriate to apply this to bids where tax planning has cancelled out this effect.

A4.6.18 Public procurement projects involving the transfer of real estate or assets that are likely
to appreciate in value can often give rise to specific tax issues, in particular liability to capital
gains tax. If public sector organisations are negotiating with bodies that wish to structure
procurement proposals in this way, they should consult the Treasury and HMRC at an early stage
to identify the likely tax implications and assess the proposal for propriety generally.
