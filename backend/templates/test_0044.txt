Those who are in the preliminary study of Karma understand
very clearly that the body does not have any Karma. It does
Karma for the Mind and Ego, ME, just as it suffers along with
ME. The Karma belongs to ME, not to the body. Those who go
into an in-depth study, also realize that Karma does not
belong to the Soul. They are enlightened with this realization.
As long as we live with ignorance, we create Karma through
the body and the Karma belongs to the Mind and Ego, ME and
we suffer again and again for our Karma. Of course, we will
also be rewarded for our good deeds. But every time we take
birth on earth, we will experience the triple suffering of the
body, mind and ego. Even though we may do good Karma,
there is no way of escaping suffering on earth. The only way
to escape from suffering is the Realization that we are not
even the Mind and Ego, ME that is directing action. The
moment we Realize the Truth of "Who am I?" we are liberated
from all Karma and all suffering, just as we are liberated from
rebirth.

When we realize that we are not the body nor are we the mind
and ego that is creating Karma, we are the Divine Soul, then
there is no Karma in our account. We become a Karma Yogi,
an instrument of God, our actions are inspired by God, and
we seek nothing from our actions. In this case, we are
liberated from Karma, from suffering and from rebirth.
