Annex 4.7
Subsidies
A4.7.1 The transition period which followed the UK's departure from the European Union
ended on 31 December 2020, and EU law ceased to have any force in the UK (save
in those areas provided for by the Withdrawal Agreement).1 UK public bodies must
continue ensure compliance with all relevant domestic and international subsidies
rules, including World Trade Organisation commitments and commitments the UK
has entered into under bilateral Trade Agreements.
A4.7.2 In certain areas the government has published updated guidance, which can
be found on gov.uk. Accounting Officers should be aware that obligations arising
from domestic and international law are binding for the whole public sector and
assist their partner organisations in complying where new obligations have arisen.
