Requests for retrospective approval should follow the same format as requests
submitted on time.
A2.2.16 If the Treasury does not give retrospective approval or authorise write-off of
irregular expenditure, the department must inform the NAO. The Treasury may also
draw the matter to the attention of the responsible accounting officer. The CRAG
may then qualify his or her opinion on the account and the PAC may decide to hold
an oral hearing. In the case of voted expenditure, the Treasury will present an excess
vote to Parliament to regularise the situation.
A2.2.17 Itis unlawful to commit resources or incur expenditure without Treasury
consent, where such consent is required by statute. In such cases retrospective
consent cannot confer legality. Such consumption cannot, therefore, be regularised.
A2.2.18 In cases of unlawful expenditure, the responsible accounting officer must
note the department's accounts accordingly and notify the NAO. It will then be for
the C&AG to decide whether to report on the matter to Parliament with the relevant
accounts and whether to draw it to the attention of the PAC.
A2.2.19 The C&AG and the Treasury cooperate closely on questions of authority for
expenditure. The C&AG may bring a department's attention to any cases where the
department:

e has ignored or wrongly interpreted a Treasury ruling;

e is attempting to rely on a mistaken delegated authority, eg where the

delegation has been changed or where consent was given orally only;
e has committed resources or incurred expenditure which the Treasury
might not have approved had it been consulted.
2.2.20 Departments should bring such cases to the attention of the Treasury,
indicating clearly the NAO interest. The Treasury and NAO keep each other in touch
with such cases.
