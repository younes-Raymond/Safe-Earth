A4.10.4 When departments identify losses and write-offs, they should consult the
Treasury, using the guidance in Box A4.10B, irrespective of the amount of money

+ contain lessons which might be of wider interest;
. are novel or contentious;

Departments should consult the Treasury as soon as possible, outlining:
* the nature of the case, the amount involved and the circumstances in which it arose;
+ the reasons for the proposed write-off, including any legal advice;
* the reason for consulting the Treasury;
* whether fraud (suspected or proven) is involved;
* whether the case resulted from dereliction of duty;
* whether failure of supervision is involved;
* whether appropriate legal and/or disciplinary action has been taken against those
involved including supervisors, and, if not, why not;
* whether those primarily involved will be required to bear any part of the loss; and
* whether the investigation has shown any defects in the existing systems of control and,
* if so, what action will be taken.
