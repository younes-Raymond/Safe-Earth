“... while it is competent to Parliament, by means of an annual vote
embodied in the Appropriation Acts, in effect to extend powers specifically
limited by statute, constitutional propriety requires that such extensions
should be regularised at the earliest possible date by amending legislation,
unless they are of a purely emergency or non-continuing character”.
“... while ... the Executive Government must continue to be allowed a
certain measure of discretion in asking Parliament to exercise a power which
undoubtedly belongs to it, they agree that practice should normally accord
with the view expressed by the Committee that, where it is desired that
continuing functions should be exercised by a government department
(particularly where such functions involve financial liabilities extending
beyond a given year) it is proper that the powers and duties to be exercised
should be defined by specific statute. The Treasury will, for their part,
continue to aim at the observance of this principle”.

A2.3.7 With this Concordat, the matter still lies.

2.3.8 Use of the Supply and Appropriation Acts as authority for expenditure is

discussed in annex 2.4.
