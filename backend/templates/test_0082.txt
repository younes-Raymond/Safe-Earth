Box 4.8: factors to consider when planning policies or projects

design

* Has the proposal been evaluated against alternative options, including doing nothing?

+ Should there be pilot testing before full roll out?

* Are the controls agreed and documented clearly? Have the risks and opportunities been
considered systematically? Is the change process resilient to shocks? What contingencies
might arise?

* Is the intended intervention proportionate to the identified need?

* What standards should be achieved? How will performance be tracked and assessed?
Could the proposal be simplified without loss of function?

If partner(s) are involved, is the allocation of responsibilities appropriate?

Will the proposal be efficient, effective and offer good value for money?

Â«Is the policy sustainable in the broadest sense? Should it have a sunset clause?

* Does the planned activity meet high standards of probity, integrity and honesty?

standards?

control

* What prior agreement is required, if any?

Should there be an SRO?
