Annex 4.6
It is important to secure value for money in asset management through sound procurement. Public
sector organisations should normally acquire goods and services through fair and open competition,
acting on Cabinet Office advice. This annex provides an overview of the policy framework for public
procurement.
A4.6.1 Good procurement practice demands that public sector organisations buy the goods, works and
services they need using fair and open procurement processes, guarding against corruption and
meeting the standards in MPM. World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements and many of the
UK's trade deals underpin these principles. The specific responsibilities are set out in box A4.6A.
