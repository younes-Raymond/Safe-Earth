Use of Public Funds
This chapter explains the process for parliamentary authorisation of public resources. Parliament
consents in principle to the use of public funds through legislation to enable specified policies. It then
approves use of public resources to carry out those policies year by year by approving Estimates. Only
rarely can lesser authority suffice. At the close of each financial year, parliament expects a clear
account of the use of the public funds it has authorised. Parliament expects the Treasury to oversee
the operation of these controls. The PAC may investigate specific issues further.
«Ministers have very broad powers to control and direct their
departments. In general, they may do anything that legislation does not
prohibit or limit, including using common law powers to administer
their operations or continue business as usual.
«Ministers also need parliamentary authority for use of public funds
before each year's expenditure can take place. The full list of
requirements is set out in box 2.1.
Box 2.1: requirements for use of public funds
+ budget cover in the collectively agreed multi-year budgets
+ with a few exceptions!, parliamentary authorisation for each year's drawdown
of funds through an Estimate, which is then approved as a Supply and
Appropriation Act (see section 2.2)
+ adequate Treasury consents (see section 2.3)
+ assurance that the proposed expenditure is regular and proper (section 2.4)
«sufficient specific legal powers - though see section 2.5 for some limited
exceptions
2.1.1 The Treasury runs the control process because parliament expects the Treasury
to control public expenditure as part of fiscal policy. The primary means through
which the Treasury controls public expenditure is multi-year budgets, agreed
collectively at spending reviews. The Consolidated Budgeting Guidance sets out the
rules for their use. (See also chapter 4).
