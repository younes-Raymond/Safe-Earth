Public Accounts - is entirely at the C&AG's discretion, as is the manner in which they
are carried out and reported. The C&AG has the same level of access for vim
examinations as for financial audit. Central government bodies must ensure that
such access is provided for within the terms and conditions of contracts and
agreements with third party contractors, sub-contractors and grant recipients.
A1.1.7 In the event of the C&AG requiring access to sensitive documents to inform
his work — for example, policy papers such as Cabinet, or Cabinet Committee, papers
— then public sector organisations should cooperate with NAO requests for access to
such information, irrespective of its classification or other sensitivity. It is important
to work closely with NAO to explain fully any publication sensitivities that may exist.
While the final decision about the contents of his or her reports must rest with the
C&AG, such close working ensures sensitivities can be properly taken into account as
the report content is finalised.
A1.1.8 The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) may decide to invite witnesses to
discuss the findings of-both financial audits and vfm examinations. The PAC may
also initiate other hearings on related matters.
The Comptroller function
A1.1.9 An important part of the C&AG's responsibilities is oversight of payments
from the Consolidated Fund and the National Loans Fund. In response to requests
from the Treasury, NAO staff establish that the sums paid out of these funds each
business day are made in accordance with legislation. Once the authorisations
(credits) are given, the Treasury may make drawings from these funds to finance the
Exchequer’s commitments.
