Annex 5.3
Treatment of income and receipts
The rules on use of income and receipts are designed to control the circumstances in which they can
finance use of public resources.
A5.3.1 Parliament controls departmentsâ€™ use of income and receipts, just ast controls the
raising of tax, since both may finance use of public resources. Departments should
ensure that all income and associated cash is recorded in full and collected
promptly.
A5.3.2 Unless otherwise authorised, cash receipts must be paid into the
Consolidated Fund. Sometimes specific legislation requires this for certain income
streams; for many others the Civil List Act 1952 classifies them as hereditary
revenues to be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
A5.3.3 Hereditary revenue is:
+ virtually all non-statutory receipts;
+ cash receipts received by virtue of specific statutory authority; and
+ receipts where statute does not say otherwise.
Unless it can be established that a particular type of receipt or surplus cash is not
hereditary revenue, the default position is that it is, and that the Civil List Act 1952
requires it to be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
AS5.3.4 The main categories of income and associated receipts are shown in Box
AS53A.
Box A5.3A: the different kinds of central government income
+ the proceeds of taxation: paid into the Consolidated Fund
+ repayment of principal and interest on NLF loans: paid direct to the NLF
