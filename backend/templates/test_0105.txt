7.15 Working with civil society bodies
7.15.1 Central government organisations may find they can deliver their objectives
effectively through relationships with civil society bodies: ie charities, social,
voluntary or community institutions, mutual organisation, social enterprises or other
not-for-profit organisations. Such partnerships can achieve more than either the
public or the civil society sector can deliver alone. For example, using a civil society
sector organisation can provide better insight into demand for, and suitable means
of delivery of public services.
7.15.2 Itis good practice to plan relationships with civil society partners through a
framework document, as with other partnerships. Some guidelines on how these
relationships can work well in harmony with policy and spending decisions are in the
Civil Society Compacts.
7.15.3 In this kind of relationship a public sector organisation may fund activities,
make grants, lend assets, or arrange other transfers to a civil society sector body
performing or facilitating delivery of services. It is desirable to build in safeguards to
ensure that resources are used as intended (see annex 5.2). This gives parliament
confidence that voted resources are used for the purposes it has approved.
7.15.4 The safeguards to be applied should be agreed at the start of the
relationship. Customisation in nearly always essential. It is often right to require
clawback, ie to agree terms in which public sector donors reclaim the proceeds if
former publicly owned assets are sold.
