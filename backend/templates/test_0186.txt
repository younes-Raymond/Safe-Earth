* procurement of goods and services, where any liability is adequately discharged once
the goods and services have been provided
* where a grant has been provided for research and not specifically for the creation of
physical asset, the successful conclusion of the research might be adequate return
A5.2.4 Because funders, recipients and circumstances can vary so much, there is no
single model for clawback. Bespoke terms are often desirable. They should allow as
much flexibility as seems sensible. The aim should be to help recipients develop and
provide services over the longer term while securing value for public funds. Drawing
on the ideas in box 7.2, funders should always settle the terms of each grant with its
recipient at the start of the relationship, consistent with its objectives.
Designing clawback conditions
A5.2.5 The design of clawback conditions for a grant should take account of its
circumstances, the underlying policy objective(s) and the funder’s approach to risk.
A checklist of some common factors to consider is in box A5.2B. Using this tailored
approach can mean different organisations take very different approaches to the
same risks.
Box A5.28: factors to consider in designing clawback terms
+ the nature and purpose of the grant
* how the asset will help secure the policy objectives behind the grant
* the expected life of the asset
+ the extent to which the recipient is financed out of public funds
* how the asset will be used by the recipient, eg scope for appreciation or generating
profit
+ how long the funder should retain an interest in the asset
* whether the asset may be sold, with any restrictions on disposal, eg as to price or
purchaser
* whether there is sense in reassessing after a certain period or on a given trigger
* whether the terms of clawback should vary according to a factor such as the asset value
(in which case the terms may need to provide for periodic valuations)
* when the policy objectives should be delivered
+ the funder’s legal powers and the recipient's legal position (eg as a company or charity)
* any other relevant legal factors
A5.2.6 In setting terms and conditions for grants, funders should consider what
could happen if things do not proceed as intended, notably what should happen if:
«the recipient does not behave as expected; or
«external conditions are very different to plans; or
+ the recipient goes into liquidation (eg should the funder take priority
over unsecured creditors).
