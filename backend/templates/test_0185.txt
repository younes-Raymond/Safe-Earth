Annex 5.2
This annex discusses how public sector organisations which provide grants to the private sector and
others should protect their investments where grants are used to buy or improve assets.
Clawback
A5.2.1 Public sector organisations providing funds to others to acquire or develop assets
should take steps to make sure that public sector funds are used for the intended
purposes for which the grant is made. It is usual to consider setting conditions on
such grants, taking into account the value of the grant, the use of the asset to be
funded and its future value.A standard grant condition is clawback. This is achieved
by setting a condition on the grant that gives the funding body a charge over the
asset so that, if the recipient proposes to sell or change the use of the asset acquired
with the grant, it must:
+ consult the funder;
+ return the grant to the funder; or
+ yield the proceeds of sale (or a specified proportion) to the funder.
A5.2.3 However, a charge over the asset is not always essential. Some ground rules
are suggested in box A5.2A.
Box A5.2A: when to consider clawback
clawback desirable
* tangible or tangible or intangible assets, including intellectual property rights, crown
copyright, patents, designs and database rights, financed directly, whether wholly or
partly by grants or grants in aid;
* tangible or intangible assets developed by the funded body itself, financed indirectly by
a grant for a related purpose or by grant in aid
clawback not always necessary
