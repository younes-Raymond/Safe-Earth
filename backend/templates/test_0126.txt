Internal financial discipline
A4.1.5 The finance director should maintain strong and effective policies to control
and manage use of resources in the organisation's activities. This includes improving
the financial literacy of budget holders in the organisation. Similarly, he or she
should ensure that there are similar disciplines in the organisation's ALBs. These
should all draw on best practice in accounting and respect the Treasury's
requirements, including, where relevant, accounts directions. These responsibilities
are described in box A4.1C.
