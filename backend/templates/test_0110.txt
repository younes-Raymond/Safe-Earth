Annex 2.2
Delegated authorities
This annex expands on the requirement for departments to obtain Treasury consent to their public
expenditure and the process of delegated authorities.
A2.2.1 Treasury approval for expenditure is one aspect of the convention that Parliament
expects the Treasury to control all other departments in matters of finance and
public expenditure. Accounting officers are responsible (see first bullet of paragraph
3.3.3) for ensuring that prior Treasury approval is obtained in all cases where it is
needed.
A2.2.2 The need for Treasury approval embraces all the ways in which departments
might make public commitments to expenditure, not just Estimates or legislation,
important as they are. Box A2.2A identifies the main ways in which the need can
arise. It may not be exhaustive.
A2.2.3 Treasury approval:
* must be confirmed in writing, even where initially given orally;
e cannot be implied in the absence of a reply;
* must be sought in good time to allow reasonable consideration before
decisions are required.
A2.2.4 Departmental ministers should be made aware when Treasury consent is
required in addition to their own.
Box A2.2A: where Treasury approval is required
* public statements or other commitments to use of public resources beyond the agreed
budget plans
* guarantees, indemnities or letters of comfort creating contingent liabilities
* any proposals outside the department's delegated limits
+ all expenditure which is novel, contentious or repercussive, irrespective of size, even if it
appears to offer value for money taken in isolation
* where legislation requires it
+ feesand charges
Where Treasury approval has been overlooked, the case should immediately be brought to
the Treasury's attention.
