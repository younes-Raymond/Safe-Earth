overpayments where recovery would be detrimental to the mental welfare of the
debtor or the debtor's family. Again, such hardship must be demonstrated by
evidence.
Collective overpayments
A4.11.21 If a group of people have all been overpaid as a result of the same
mistake, the recipients should be treated in the same way. However, that does not
mean that recovery of all such overpayments should be automatically written off.
For example, it may be legitimate to continue to effect recovery from those who
have offered to repay, or some may not be subject to the same level of hardship.
A4.11.22 Public sector organisations should decide how best to handle collective
overpayments so that they do not inhibit the maximum recovery possible. If it is
deemed impractical to pursue recovery from some members of an equivalent group,
there should be no inhibition on pursuing others who may be able to pay. There is
no obligation to inform the group generally about what action is being taken
against particular members since all have the same legal obligation. Any differential
treatment should be based on advice.
A4.11.23 If a public sector organisation is minded to forgo recovery of the whole or
any part of a collective overpayment, it should consult the Treasury (or its sponsor
department, as the case may be) before telling the recipients of the overpayments.
The Treasury will need to be satisfied that a collective waiver is defensible in the
public interest or as value for money. And any such waivers should be exceptional.
