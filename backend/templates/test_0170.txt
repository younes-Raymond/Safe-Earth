Box A4.13B: factors to consider in special severance cases
Any case for special severance put to the treasury should explain:
* the circumstances of the case
«any scope for reference to a tribunal with its potential consequences, including the legal
assessment of the organisation's chances of winning or losing the case and likely scale
of any award
+ the management procedures followed
«the value for money offered by the possible settlement
+ any non-financial considerations, eg where it is desirable to end someone's employment
without dismissal, perhaps because of restructuring
* whether the case could have wider impact, eg for a group of potential tribunal cases
A4.13.14 Particular care should be taken to:
«avoid unnecessary delays which might lead to greater severance
payments than might otherwise be merited;
«avoid offering the employee concerned consultancy work after
severance unless best value for money can be demonstrated and the
proposal is in line with Cabinet Office approvals and controls3;
+ ensure any undertakings about confidentiality leave severance
transactions open to adequate public scrutiny, including by the NAO
and the PAC;
= ensure special severance payments to senior staff are transparent and
negotiated avoiding conflicts of interest.
A4.13.15 Organisations seeking retrospective Treasury approval for special severance
payments should not take it for granted that approval will be provided, since such
payments usually appear to reward failure and set a poor example for the public
sector generally. Requests for retrospective approval will be considered as if the
request had been made at the proper time and should contain the same level of
detail as if the case had been brought to the Treasury in advance.
Retention Payments
A4.13.16 Retention payments, designed to encourage staff to delay their
departures, particularly where transformations of ALBs are being negotiated, are
also classified as novel and contentious. Such payments always require explicit
Treasury approval, whether proposed in individual cases or in groups. Treasury
approval must be obtained before any commitment, whether oral or in writing, is
made.
A4.13.17 Organisations considering proposals for retention payments should
subject them to strict value for money analysis. Sponsor departments should submit
a business case to the Treasury, supported by market evidence, together with an
