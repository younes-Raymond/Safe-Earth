time of publication. Actual liabilities should appear as provisions. The rubric should
refer back to notification of parliament.
A5.4.44 When the conditional features of contingent liabilities are met, it is good
practice to wait until parliament has approved the relevant Estimate before
providing the necessary resources. But if providing support is more urgent,
departments should apply for an advance from the Contingencies Fund (see Annex
2.4 and the Estimates Manual? under the usual conditions). If an advance is
approved, a statement to parliament should explain what is happening, and in
particular how the crystallised liability is to be met.
International agreements
AS5.4.45 International treaties, agreements or commercial commitments which mean
the UK incurring specific contingent liabilities should follow the parliamentary
reporting procedures as far as possible whether or not the agreement is covered by
legislation. Even if an international agreement does not require legislation for
ratification, it should nevertheless be laid before parliament, accompanied by an
explanatory memorandum, for 21 sitting days before it is ratified (the Ponsonby
rule).
