Foreword
About this document

i. This document updates the version published in 2007. Like the original,
it sets out the main principles for dealing with resources in UK public
sector organisations Some of the specifics, especially those in the
annexes, relate to England rather than the devolved administrations,
which have their own detailed rulebooks. But the same basic principles
generally apply in all parts of the UK public sector, with adjustments for
context.

ii. The key themes also remain. They are the fiduciary duties of those
handling public resources to work to high standards of probity; and the
need for the public sector to work in harmony with parliament.

fii. While these principles are invariant, the advice in this document cannot
stand forever. The law, business practices, and public expectations all
change. So public sector organisations can and should innovate in
carrying out their responsibilities, using new technology and adopting
good business practice. Throughout parliament always expects the
government and its public servants to meet the ethical standards in this
document and to operate transparently.

iv. As before, the main text of the document is intended to be timeless. The
Treasury will revise the annexes from time to time as the need arises. All
the text is available freely on the gov.uk website.

v. Above all, nothing in this document should discourage the application of
sheer common sense.
