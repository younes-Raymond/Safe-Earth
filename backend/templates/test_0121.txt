+ insight into the organisation's performance from internal audit,
including an audit opinion on the quality of the systems of governance,
management and risk control;

+ feedback from the delegation chain(s) within the organisation about its
business, its use of resources, its responses to risks, the extent to which
in year budgets and other targets have been met, and any other
internal accountability mechanisms; including:

— bottom-up information and assessments to generate a full
appreciation of performance and risks as they are perceived from
within the organisation;

— end-to-end assessments of processes, since it is possible to neglect
interdependent and compounded risks if only the components are
considered;

— a high level overview of the organisation's business so that
systemic risks can be considered in the round;

— any evidence from internal control failures or poor risk
management;

— potentially, information from whistleblowers;

— material from any arm's length bodies (ALBs) connected with the
organisation which may shed light on the performance of the
organisation or its board.

affecting the organisation in the round, not neglecting the more serious (if remote)
risks!, emerging technology and other cutting edge developments. It should also
mention any protective security concerns in suitably careful termsz, with details
reported to the external auditor.

+ provide an explanation of how the department ensures that use of any
resources granted to certain locally governed organisations (including
the NHS) is satisfactory. See A3.1.12.
