Asset management strategies
A4.15.7 The asset management strategy of a public sector organisation should be integrated
into its corporate and annual business plans. It should thus be possible to help plan change in
asset use or deployment when necessary. Box A.4.15B suggests some key steps. The
organisation's board should take stock of progress in delivering its asset management strategy
from time to time, and at least annually.

Box A4.15B: steps for developing asset management plans

* Review the asset register to assess its adequacy for the organisation's objectives and functions.

+ Plan how retained assets will be used efficiently for the organisation's core functions.

+ Plan asset acquisitions, e.g. to extend, modify or replace the existing asset base.

+ Identify disposals, and plan to use the proceeds. Once decided upon, disposals should be as
swift as the market will allow with reasonable value for money). Treasury approval is required for
spending or retaining receipts.

+ Plan any loans of assets, with charges and conditions for their return, liability, damage.
