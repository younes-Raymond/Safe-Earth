ANCIENT BULGARIA
From about 400 BC a race called the Thracians lived in parts of what is now
Bulgaria. The Thracians were a tribal society and they were superb
horsemen. They were also known for making beautiful gold and silver
jewellery.
By 100 AD the Romans conquered Bulgaria. The Romans founded the city
of Trimontium (modern day Plodiv). They also built the city of Serdica on
the site of Sofia.
In 395 the Roman Empire split in two. Bulgaria became part of the Eastern
Roman Empire (later called the Byzantine Empire). However Byzantium
grew weaker and about 500 AD Slavs settled in Bulgaria.
Then in 680 the Bulgars invaded led by their ruler Khan Asparukh. They
were descended from the Huns from Central Asia. They crossed the
Danube and founded the state of Bulgaria. They then intermarried with the
Slavs.
In 716 the Byzantine Empire recognised the state of Bulgaria.
However in the late 8th century the Emperor Constantine V tried to destroy
Bulgaria - but without success. Then the pendulum swung the other way.
From 809 Khan Krum attacked the Byzantine Empire. Led by Khan Krum
the Bulgars were victorious. In 811 the Byzantine Emperor, Nicephorus was
killed in battle. Krum had his skull covered in silver and used it for drinking.
In 813 Krum even lay siege to Constantinople, the capital of Byzantium but
he failed to capture it. Finally in 816 Khan Omurtag made peace.
Then in 846 Boris | of Bulgaria accepted Christianity and his subjects
followed. Bulgaria accepted the Eastern Orthodox Church rather than the
western Catholic Church.
Bulgaria reached a peak under Simeon the Great 893-927. He called
himself ‘Emperor of all the Bulgars and Greeks'. The pope recognised him
but the Byzantine emperor did not!
