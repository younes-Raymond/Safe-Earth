Annex 5.1

This annex sets out how government departments should arrange and control grants, including to

arm's length bodies such as NDPBs.

AS5.1.1 Central government departments normally offer two kinds of financial support to
third parties, using statutory powers:

Â«grants: made for specific purposes, under statute, and satisfying specific
conditions eg about project terms, or with other detailed control;

* grants in aid: providing more general support, usually for an NDPB, with
fewer specific, but more general controls on the body, and less oversight by
the funder.

A5.1.2 Grants should not be confused with contracts. A public sector organisation
funds by grant as a matter of policy, not in return for services provided under
contract.

Payment

AS5.1.3 Grants should be paid on evidence of need or qualification, depending on
the terms of the grant scheme. For example:

* the recipient may need to demonstrate financial viability and delivery
capability;

* the recipient may need to submit a claim with evidence of eligibility;

othe recipient may need to show that it meets the conditions of the
scheme, eg a farmer may need to disclose details of his or her business;

* there may be a timing condition;

+ small third sector organisations may need to demonstrate a clear
operational requirement for project funding to be made before grant is
paid.

A5.1.4 Grants in aid should also match the recipient's need. Significant sums should

be phased through the year in instalments designed to echo the recipient's

expenditure pattern. In this way the recipient organisation need not carry significant

cash balances, which would be an inefficient use of public money.

Control

A5.1.5 Payment of both grants and grants in aid normally requires specific

empowering legislation as well as cover in Estimates. There is scope for temporary ex
