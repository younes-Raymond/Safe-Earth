A4.2.6 It is always good practice to evaluate the risks associated with any model so
that the ultimate users of the model can appreciate what it can and cannot deliver.
Sophisticated models may demand specialist expertise and leadership but the vital
element of constructive lay oversight should never be skimped. Otherwise there can
be a danger that flaws are overlooked because the experts concentrate on the
technical complexities.
A4.2.7 In managing a model, the SRO should consciously decide how it can provide
good value for money. There is no point, for instance, in data collection to a high
degree of accuracy if the assumptions used in the model cannot be exact. Similarly,
there is a stronger case for investing in a model if it forms a central part of a
decision making process.

Following the report by Sir Nicholas Macpherson into the quality assurance of
analytical models that inform government policy, a cross-departmental working
group on analytical quality assurance was established. The Aqua Book (at the
following link) is one of their key products, and provides a good practice guide for
those working with analysis and analytical models. The landing webpage also links
to a number of other associated resources on quality assurance and modelling.
