A3.1.10 All the items in this box are important. The risk assessment is critical. This is
where the AO, supported by the board, should discuss how the organisation's risk
management and internal control mechanism work, and why they were chosen to
deliver reasonable assurance about prevention, deterrent or other appropriate action
to manage the actual and potential problems or opportunities facing the
organisation. Avoiding lengthy description of process, it should assess the evidence
about the effectiveness in practice of the risk management processes in place. In
doing so it should face frankly up to any revealed deficiencies as risks have
materialised.

Box A3.1A: essential features of the governance statement

* the governance framework of the organisation, including information about the board's
committee structure, its attendance records, and the coverage of its work;

+ the board's performance, including its assessment of its own effectiveness;

+ highlights of board committee reports, notably by the audit and nomination
committees;

* an account of corporate governance, including the board's assessment of its
compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, with explanations of any departures;

+ information about the quality of the data used by the board, and why the board finds it
acceptable;

* where relevant (for certain central government departments), an account of how
resources made available to certain locally governed organisations are distributed and
how the department gains assurance about their satisfactory use;

+ arisk assessment (see annex 4.3), including the organisation's risk profile, and how it is
managed, including, subject to a public interest test:

- any newly identified risk

A3.1.11 In putting together the governance statement, the AO needs to take a view
on the extent to which items are significant enough to the welfare of the
organisation as a whole to be worth recording. There are no hard and fast rules
about this. Some factors to take into account are suggested in box A3.1B.

Box A3.1B: deciding what to include in the governance statement

* might the issue prejudice achievement of the business plan? â€” or other priorities?

* could the issue undermine the integrity or reputation of the organisation?

* what view does the board's audit committee take on the point?

* what advice or opinions have internal audit and/or external audit given?

* could delivery of the standards expected of the AO (box3.1) be at risk?

* might the issue increase the risk of fraud or other misuse of resources?

* does the issue put a significant programme or project at risk?

* could the issue divert resources from another significant aspect of the business?
