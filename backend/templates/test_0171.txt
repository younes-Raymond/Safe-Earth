evaluation of the risks and costs of alternative options. The Treasury will always be
sceptical of whether they are necessary.
Reporting
A4.13.18 As parliament does not provide for special payments when voting
Estimates or passing specific legislation, special payments should be brought to
parliament's attention, usually through a note in the organisation's account. Any
special severance payments for senior staff will in any case be itemised in annual
accounts.
A4.13.19 Notification is separate from accounting treatment, which will depend on
the nature of the special payment. Special payments should be noted in the
accounts even if they may be reduced by subsequent recoveries.
A4.13.20 Special payments should be noted in annual accounts where the total
value exceeds £300,000. Individual payments of more than £300,000 should be
noted separately.
Reporting to Cabinet Office
A4.13.21 Departments and their ALBs are required to report to the Minister for the
Cabinet Office on a quarterly basis any special severance payment made in
connection with the termination of employment. These returns will enable Cabinet
Office to provide assurance on whether the use of special severance payments across
the Civil Service is both proportionate and appropriate, including the use of any
confidentiality clauses alongside such payments. A pro forma is availables
Civil Service-wide data on special severance payments will be published annually by
the Cabinet Office.
