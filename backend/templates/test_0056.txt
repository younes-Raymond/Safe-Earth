of subjects over a period, taking account of the risks to value for money

and parliament's interests.
1.6.3 The C&AG has a general right to inspect the books of a wide variety of public
organisations to further these investigations. When the NAO investigates any public
sector organisation, it should get full cooperation in provision of papers and other
oversight. It is good practice to draw the NAQO's attention to the confidentiality of
any sensitive documents provided in this process. It is then for the independent
C&AG to judge what material can be published in the public interest.
1.6.4 In addition, the C&AG publishes other independent reports to parliament. The
PAC (see section 3.5) may hold hearings to examine evidence on any of these
reports and on other related matters.
