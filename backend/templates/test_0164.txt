Annex 4.12
This annex explains how departments should notify parliament of gifts, both given and received. It is
important to assure parliament that propriety has been respected through transparent reporting
A4.12.1 Agiftis something voluntarily donated, with no preconditions and without the
expectation of any return. In this document, the term gift includes all transactions
which are economically indistinguishable from gifts: see box A4.12AIt is also
important to be clear about transactions which do not score as gifts. For example:
Â«transfers of assets between government departments should generally
be at full current market value; assets transferred under a transfer of
functions order to implement a machinery of government change are
generally made at no charge. In neither case are such transfers
regarded as gifts;
+ grants and grants-in-aid are not gifts as they are made under
legislation, subject to conditions, with some expectation that the
government will receive value through the furtherance of its policy
objectives.
+ grants in kind that are part of a planned programme of HMG support
for an organisation or third country (for example, the provision of
equipment in official development assistance projects). Again, there is
an expectation that the government will receive value through the
furtherance of its policy objectives in precisely the same way as with
financial support to a partner organisation or the direct delivery of
projects by government. Such grants in kind will normally be made
under the same legislation that supports other parts of the programme
concerned and the purchase of the equipment concerned will typically
have been financed through provision in the department's Estimate
Box A4.12A: definition of gifts
Gifts include all transactions economically equivalent to free and unremunerated transfers from
departments to others, such as:
+ loan of an asset for its expected useful life
+ sale or lease of assets at below market value (the difference between the amount
received and the market value is the value of the gift)
