Annex 4.8
Expenditure and payments
As part of the process of authorising and controlling commitments and expenditure of public funds,
public sector organisations should time their expenditure and payments to provide good value for
public money.
A4.8.1 Public sector organisations should use good commercial practice in managing the
flows of expenditure and commitments they deal with. Box 4.3 has some sound
high level principles. These need to be interpreted in the context of each
organisation's business, in line with current legislation and using modern
commercial practice. The actual techniques used may thus change from time to time
and from place to place.
A4.8.2 In particular, public sector organisations should;
+ explain payment procedures to suppliers;
+ agree payment terms at the outset and stick to them;
«pay bills in accordance with agreed terms, or as required by law;
«tell suppliers without delay when an invoice is contested; and
+ settle quickly when a contested invoice gets a satisfactory response.
A4.8.3 Public sector organisations are also bound by legislation! aiming to ensure
that in commercial transactions, the payment period does not exceed 30 calendar
days after the debtor receives an invoice. Further advice is available from the Cabinet
Office and BEIS.
A4.8.4 However, the Government recognises that the public sector should set a
strong example by paying promptly. Central government departments should aim to
pay 80% of undisputed invoices within 5 days. They should also include a clause in
their contracts requiring prime contractors to pay their suppliers within 30 days. The
principles in Box 4.4 must still be applied to all payments. Further guidance is
available .
