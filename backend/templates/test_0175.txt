Consulting the Treasury
A4.14.15 When considering making individual remedy payments, departments need
to consult the Treasury (and sponsored bodies need to consult their sponsor
departments) about cases which:

«fall outside their delegated authorities; or

+ raise novel or contentious issues; or

+ could set a potentially expensive precedent or cause repercussions for

other public sector organisations.
A4.14.16 Public sector organisations developing schemes to pay remedies should
consult the Treasury before finalising them. Proposed schemes drawn up in response
to a PHSO recommendation also require Cabinet Office approval. Once a scheme is
agreed, it is only necessary to consult the Treasury further about cases outside the
agreed boundaries for the scheme, or the delegated authority applying to it.
Reporting ex gratia payments
A4.14.17 Departments should ensure that ex gratia payments have Estimate cover,
and that the ambit of the vote concerned is wide enough for the purpose. Ex gratia
payments score as special payments in departments’ accounts. Departments and
agencies should include summary information on compensation payments arising
from maladministration in their annual reports.
