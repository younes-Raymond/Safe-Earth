Reporting fraud
A4.9.8 Public sector organisations should retain records of internal and external
frauds discovered and actions taken, including an assessment of the value of any
losses. They may need to contribute to occasional reports and analysis of frauds.
These should be reported to the centre of the government's Counter Fraud Function
via the Consolidated Data Return.
A4.9.9 Public sector organisations should also provide the Counter Fraud Function’s
Centre of Expertise with details, of any novel or unusual frauds (or attempted frauds)
so that this information can be shared more widely. Public sector organisations
should also consider reporting frauds and suspected fraud to the NAO.
