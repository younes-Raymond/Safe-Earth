# SafEarth Relief App

Welcome to the SafEarth Relief App! This application is designed to provide relief and support to communities worldwide in times of crisis. Our mission is to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people around the world through collaboration and compassion.

## About Us

SafEarth started with a vision - a vision to make a meaningful difference in the lives of people around the world. Our journey began in the heart of a small community, where a group of passionate individuals came together with the common goal of creating positive change. As we evolved, we realized the power of collaboration. SafEarth is not just a non-profit organization; it's a movement. We collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and perspectives, uniting under the shared belief that together, we can build a better future.

Our relief app contains a blog and PDF generator as services. The primary aim of developing this app is to assist people worldwide during earthquakes. When an earthquake occurs, users can update the center and magnitude of the quake. The app will mark all villages and cities around the epicenter. 

Additionally, subscribers will have access to services like extracting text from images. Our system can process up to 1000 images and generate PDF files containing the extracted text. Users can also customize the layout of the PDF files created. In the backend section, the system can analyze headers and paragraphs, simplifying the process for users.
